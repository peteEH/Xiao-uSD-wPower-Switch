# Xiao-uSD-wPower-Switch

You should definately purchase a pre-made Adafruit variant: https://www.adafruit.com/product/5683 --- if you don't need a power switch.
- free to select the right p-channel FET that is logic-level compatible, has lower RDSon for the SDcard rail
- hard to beat the Adafruit board for cost... but shipping to Canada is a killer!


ChatGPT Summary of the Schematic PDF:

The document provides a schematic for a microSD (uSD) card adapter with a power switch, specifically designed for use with Xiao or QT Py microcontrollers. It details the electrical components and their configurations, including capacitors, resistors, and a power MOSFET (Q1) for controlling power to the SD card. The schematic includes connections for power, ground, and various data lines (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, CS_N) necessary for SPI communication with the SD card. It also specifies the physical dimensions of the board and the placement of connectors and components, ensuring compatibility with the Xiao or QT Py form factor.
